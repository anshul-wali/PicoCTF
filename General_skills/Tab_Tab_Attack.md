- Unzip the using "unzip Addadshashanammu.zip" command. We will then get a directory. 
- Run "cd directory_name" and press tab to auto complete the directory's full path (we will need to press tab 11 times). At the last directory we will get a file. 
- Run "file fang-of-haynekhtnamet" to see what type of file this is. We found out that it's a exe file.
- Run the exe file using "./fang-of-haynekhtnamet". In the output we'll get our flag.
