- Open the link and go the website.
- On the website it says 'Enter valid credentials to proceed'. I tried a random string but the alert says 'incorrect password'.
- So first thing I did was inspect the code, to my surprise the flag was in the code of website but it was not in the correct format as it was broden down into small
  strings.
- In order to bring the flag in correct format, the code needed to be understood. In this `if (checkpass.substring(0, split)` the substring starts from `0` and ends at
  `split`, the next string start form `split` and end at `split*2` and it goes on till `split*8`.
- Arrange these substrings and you'll find the flag.
