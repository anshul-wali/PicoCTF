- Open the link, you will se two options 'choose red' and 'choose blue'.
- I inspected the code first and found nothing there. Also the page doesn't do anything other than change color on click of the buttons.
- I used a tool called burpsuite to capture the requests send by the website. Open burpsuite, go to proxy tab and turn on the interpretor. After this refresh the website, you will see that there is request captured
  in burpsuite. In the first line of request we see that HTTP header used is 'GET', and for blue color the HTTP header is 'POST'. [Read more about HTTP headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods)
