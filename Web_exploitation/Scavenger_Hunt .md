- Click the llnk which opens a boring HTML website. 
- ctrl + Shift + I to bring up the source code. In the source code we find our first part of flag. In the head tag of the source code we find two flies which are linked to it, let's access them. We can do that by typing '/mycss.css' like `http://mercury.picoctf.net:39491/mycss.css`, here we will find our second part of flag.
- We'll do that same for 'myjs.js', in this we find 'How can I keep Google from indexing my website?'. On googling aabout this, I came to know about the robot exclusion files which are used to indicate to visiting web crawlers and other web robots which portions of the website they are allowed to visit. I added the `/robots.txt` at the end of the url and here we will find our part 3 of flag. We will also find a clue to out next flag which is ' I think this is an apache server... can you Access the next flag?'
- The htaccess manages Apache serve permissions, add `/.htaccess` to the url and we'll find our part 4 of our flag and next clue 'I love making websites on my Mac, I can Store a lot of information there.'
- .DS_Store is a special MacOS file that stores information about the current folder. Add `/.DS_Store` to the url and we'll find our final part of flag.
