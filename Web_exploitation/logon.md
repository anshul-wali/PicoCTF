- Open the website, we see there is a login page. Try to login as Joe which is given in description.
- I tried to login without any username and password, it also worked. This means there is no verifiction in the login page.
- On the next page it says  `No flag for you`. On inspecting the code I found nothing, now let's inspect the cookies.
- To inspect cookies, go to the network tab and then to cookies section. In flag, you'll see that cookie admin's value is `False`, edit it to `True` using burp suite. You will then find the flag.
