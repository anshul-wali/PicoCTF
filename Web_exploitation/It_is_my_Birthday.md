- In the description it mentions about having "same md5 hash".
- So I searched about `md5 collisions` and found websites and articles talking about it.
- On this [website](https://www.mscs.dal.ca/~selinger/md5collision/) I found two files [hello](https://www.mscs.dal.ca/~selinger/md5collision/hello.exe) and
  [erase](https://www.mscs.dal.ca/~selinger/md5collision/erase.exe). I changed their extensions from .exe to .pdf and upload them.
- After uploading, on the next page there was php code where I found the flag.
