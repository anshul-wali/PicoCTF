- Open the link to view the website.
- We see the 'snickerdoodle' as a suggestion in the text, I typed it and pressed the search button. Upon doing so, I was taken to another page which says 'I love snickerdoodle cookies!'.
- As the name of the challange is 'cookies', I inspected the newly opened page, in storage tab I found the value of cookie to be 0.
- Now there are two ways in which we can change the values of cookie, first one is lengthy as we have to manually change the value of cookie in the storage tab.
- Second is to use Burp Suite, capture the request of this 'I love snickerdoodle cookies!' page in the Proxy tab by turning on the interpretor , you will see `Cookie: name=0`. Right click and select 'send to intruder', here select the '0' like `Cookie: name=ยง0ยง` and then go to payload tab. Keep all the setting default, in the payload setting section add numbers individually. After adding all the number click the 'Start Attack' button on the top right.
- A new tab will open in which we will the reponses of each 20 numbers, click the number whose result you want to see. If you want render the response, click reponses button and after this click render, you will see rendered website's as reponse.
