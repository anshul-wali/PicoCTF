- From the title it is clear that we have to use Burp suite in this challange.
- Intercepted the request in the Burpsuite when I tried to login after filling all the details, in it intercepted request there was nothing.
- On the next page, there it was asking for otp. I entered a random otp and clicked submit. In this request there was an extra parimeter `otp`. First I tried to delete
this, it did not work. So, I replaced it with `new=141` perimeter, this worked and I found the flag.
